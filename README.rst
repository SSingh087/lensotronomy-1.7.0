``lenstronomy`` is a multi-purpose package to model strong gravitational lenses. The software package is presented in
`Birrer & Amara 2018 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09746v1>`_ and is based on `Birrer et al 2015 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...813..102B>`_.
``lenstronomy`` finds application for time-delay cosmography and measuring
the expansion rate of the universe, for quantifying lensing substructure to infer dark matter properties, morphological quantifications of galaxies,
quasar-host galaxy decomposition and many more.
A (incomplete) list of publications making use of lenstronomy can be found `at this link <https://github.com/sibirrer/lenstronomy/blob/master/PUBLISHED.rst>`_.


The development is coordinated on `GitHub <https://github.com/sibirrer/lenstronomy>`_ and contributions are welcome.
The documentation of ``lenstronomy`` is available at `readthedocs.org <http://lenstronomy.readthedocs.org/>`_ and
the package is distributed over `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lenstronomy>`_.
``lenstronomy`` is an `affiliated package <https://www.astropy.org/affiliated/>`_ of `astropy <https://www.astropy.org/>`_.



Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install lenstronomy --user


Modelling Features
------------------

* a variety of analytic lens model profiles
* various lensing computation tools (lens equation solver, ray-tracing etc)
* API to conveniently simulating mock lenses
* Extended source reconstruction with basis sets (shapelets)
* Model fitting and statistical inference tools with MPI and multi-threading support (Particle swarm optimization, emcee, MultiNest, DyPolyChord, or Dynesty) with MPI and multi-threading support
* integrated support for multi-lens plane and multi-source plane modelling
* Kinematic modelling (Jeans anisotropy models) of lens deflector galaxy

Getting started
---------------

The `starting guide jupyter notebook <https://github.com/sibirrer/lenstronomy_extensions/blob/master/lenstronomy_extensions/Notebooks/starting_guide.ipynb>`_
leads through the main modules and design features of ``lenstronomy``. The modular design of ``lenstronomy`` allows the
user to directly access a lot of tools and each module can also be used as stand-alone packages.


Example notebooks
-----------------

We have made an extension module available at `https://github.com/sibirrer/lenstronomy_extensions <https://github.com/sibirrer/lenstronomy_extensions>`_.
You can find simple examle notebooks for various cases. The latest versions of the notebooks should be compatible with the recent pip version of lenstronomy.

Requirements
------------
To run lens models with elliptical mass distributions, the fastell4py package, originally from Barkana (fastell),
is also required and can be cloned from: `https://github.com/sibirrer/fastell4py <https://github.com/sibirrer/fastell4py>`_ (needs a fortran compiler)

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install gfortran
    $ git clone https://github.com/sibirrer/fastell4py.git <desired location>
    $ cd <desired location>
    $ python setup.py install --user

--------------------------------------------

We provide some examples where a real galaxy has been lensed and then been reconstructed by a shapelet basis set.

* `HST quality data with perfect knowledge of the lens model <http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~sibirrer/video/true_reconstruct.mp4>`_
* `HST quality with a clump hidden in the data <http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~sibirrer/video/clump_reconstruct.mp4>`_
* `Extremely large telescope quality data with a clump hidden in the data <http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~sibirrer/video/TMT_high_res_clump_reconstruct.mp4>`_
